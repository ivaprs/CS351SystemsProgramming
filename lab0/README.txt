To run generate-dataset.sh type bash generate-dataset.sh <filename> <num_records>
make sure to add the file extension .txt in the filename because the code doesn't do it for you

To run sort-data.sh type bash sort-data.sh <filename>
the file name is the same as the file name you inputted for generate-dataset.sh

I have two .txt files called timesGen and timesSort which hold the real times values generated by 
running the commands time bash generate-dataset.sh test.txt <1000, 100000, and 10000000> and
time bash sort-data.sh test.txt
These files are used to generate the plot seen in the report and the plot can be generated
for yourself by typing python3 genGraph.py

Thanks for grading, TA!
